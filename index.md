The Particl Foundation is an entity created with the main purpose of supporting a blockchain based project named Particl. Particl is an open source, decentralized privacy platform built for global person to person and business to person eCommerce. The native marketplace, tokens and suite of encrypted communication tools offer unfettered access between buyers and sellers worldwide or just down the street.

## Business

Particl will provide a self-governed marketplace operating under a secured distributed network instead of a centralized server. This will be an attractive option for anyone who buys or sells anything online as it will have minimal sales fees for sellers, making their products more competitive, as well as secured transactions, making it extremely difficult for anyone to know what items will be bought or sold. In order to ensure illegal goods would be kept away from the marketplace, a self-governing mechanism will be set in place, giving the community authority to vote out certain products. In a world where security is slowly becoming more compromised, it is one of the foundation's goals to enable the offering of competitive products worldwide, at the same time making it difficult for others to judge people based on their sexual orientation, religious beliefs, political views and other prejudice.

## Purpose

The Foundation's purpose is promoting and developing new technologies and applications, especially in the fields of new open and decentralized software architectures. A dominating but not exclusive focus is set on the promotion and development of the so-called Particl Protocol and the related technologies, as well as the promotion and support of applications using the Particl Protocol.

## Concept

The Foundation's mission is to promote and develop new open and decentralized software architectures, in particular the Particl protocol.

Particl will provide a self-governed marketplace operating under a secured distributed network instead of a centralized server owned by a company. This will be an attractive option for anyone who buys or sells anything online as it will have minimal sales fees for sellers (making product prices more competitive) as well as providing confidential transactions and communication, (making it extremely difficult for anyone to know who bought what and for how much). In a world where privacy is slowly becoming more and more compromised, it is one of the foundation's goal to offer competitive products worldwide while protecting user rights regardless of their sexual orientation, religious beliefs, political views or other prejudice.

The Particl platform, and the marketplace specifically, will have self-governance functionality hardcoded into the protocol to prohibit the sale of illegal goods and prevent sellers of such goods the ability to use the network. Safeguards such as default categories, a reputation system and a voting governance system will allow the users to own and maintain the platform while staying true to Particl's peer-to-peer, decentralized, open source roots.
